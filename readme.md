# Final project

Namby-pamby is my final project from JavaScript developer: React bootcamp.

It is a simple application which helps to find random place for vacations. Moreover, it presents basic information about chosen country, including the exchange rate, shows current weather and indicates the place on the map.

## Used technologies

- HTML, CSS;
- React;
- jQuery; 
- Ajax;
- 4 different REST APIs: 
	* [country info](https://restcountries.eu/)
	* [exchange rate](http://fixer.io/)
	* [weather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
	* [map](https://developers.google.com/maps/);
